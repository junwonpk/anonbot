Facebook Bot that helps counselors and customers communicate anonymously.
Customer messages this bot. This bot then takes the message and sends to
one of the counselors. Counselor messages back to this bot, then the bot
responds to the customer. All of the communication is done such that the
counselor and the customer do not discover the identity of each other in
the process.
